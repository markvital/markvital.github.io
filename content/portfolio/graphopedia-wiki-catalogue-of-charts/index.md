Together with my partner I build the extensive catalogue of graphs and charts, which supports content collaborators.
The catalogue is implemented as a static website generator. The collaborators could edit each article in Markdown and submit changes through the  Github.  The website is build on Gatsby.js and React.js.

The homepage has grid, list and groups view, displaying all the charts with separate controls for switching between the views and sorting. The articles are linking between each other with complex relationship using system of tags and properties, described in Markdown YAML.


**Tech**: Gatsby.js, React.js, Markdown, YAML, Algolia Doc Search, Github

**Scope**: Development, Design, Research
