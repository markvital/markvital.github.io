Together with a team I developed a dashboard that shows the most popular types of charts using Google Trends API.
The the dashboard app connects to the Google Trends through API and refreshes the data daily. Itâ€™s implemented as a static site generator on Python.
The frontend is building on React.js. I used D3.js to build the charts.
On the backend the data was cleaned and aggregated using Python.
