I build a proof-of concept of web-based vector editor to build infographics for Adioma 2.0. All the geometry is rendered using in-browser SVG capabilities. The editor is using React.js to Manipulate SVG and React hooks as state management.â€¨
It supports selecting and manipulation with multiple objects, multi-line formatted text, inserting icons and illustrations.
The documents are stored in MongoDB database on backend.
The users, authentification system is implemented using JSON-web token.
The backend is managed with ReactAdmin.

*Tech*: React, Node.js, MongoDB, SVG, ReactAdmin

Scope: development
